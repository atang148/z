NCQA and seven organizations are examining a new way to measure outcomes in older adults that focuses on person-driven outcomes—outcomes identified by individuals (and caregivers) as important.

View Measuring What Matters Most to Older Adults

Understanding what is most important to an individual is key to the concept of person-centered care. This report highlights in-the-field examples of keys to eliciting, understanding and attaining individual’s goals.

Read Goals to Care

People with complex needs—such as older adults with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations as well as persons with physical, intellectual or developmental disabilities—often require combinations of medical care, behavioral health care and long-term services and supports (LTSS). Better integration of these health care services can improve care, improve quality and reduce costs.

Read Policy Approaches to Advancing Person-Centered Outcome Measurement

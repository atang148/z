Rules for Allowable Adjustments of HEDIS

Recognizing that HEDIS measures have traditionally been specified for health plan reporting, NCQA developed the Rules for Allowable Adjustment of HEDIS to accommodate the application of HEDIS measures to various levels of the health care system for quality improvement initiatives. The rules provide flexibility for evaluating different populations without altering measures’ clinical intent (e.g., removal of continuous enrollment or product-line criteria).

The Rules for Allowable Adjustments are included in the HEDIS Volume 2 publication after the applicable HEDIS measure specifications. NCQA’s HEDIS Value Set Directory (VSD) includes the necessary third-party codes for use with adjusted measure specifications.

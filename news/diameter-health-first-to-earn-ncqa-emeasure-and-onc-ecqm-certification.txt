Diameter Health First to Earn NCQA eMeasure and ONC eCQM Certification

Company used Test Report from NCQA’s Authorized Testing Lab (ATL) for ONC submission.

Washington, DC, July 31, 2019—Diameter Health, a market leader in clinical data integration, has become the first organization to earn eMeasure certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as well as certification from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) Health IT Certification Program.

 

Diameter Health first attained NCQA eMeasure certification from NCQA. The company then used the test report from NCQA’s ONC-Authorized Testing Lab to earn Health IT certification for the eCQM criteria from the federal government. As an ONC-Authorized Testing Lab, NCQA can test quality measures as part of the ONC Health IT Certification program. NCQA is the only approved alternative to the four government-based electronic testing procedures for quality measures.

 

A leading provider of clinical data integration technology, Diameter Health improves the data cleanliness and usability of clinical information for Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), health plans, and state- and federal initiatives. While the industry is moving towards greater measure alignment, various programs still use different quality measures. By successfully completing both rigorous certification programs, Diameter Health meets the requirements for a broad range of stakeholders, from providers measuring quality through participation in MIPS to health plans measuring the quality of their plans through HEDIS.

 

“It’s always been NCQA’s vision to provide the nation’s most robust measurement validation methodology while reducing the burden of the certification process for vendors,” said Rick Moore, Chief Information Officer, NCQA. “We are pleased to see Diameter Health charting another first by taking the lead and taking advantage of our ONC Authorized Test Lab. They clearly valued our rigorous validation methodology and results to help them earn ONC’s Electronic Health Record Technology certification. We congratulate Diameter for holding its products to a higher standard and paving the way for the industry with our dual-purpose certification program.”

“Diameter Health is proud to be the first organization certified by both the NCQA and ONC, and to be certified for more e-clinical quality measures than any other vendor,” said Eric Rosow, Chief Executive Officer, Diameter Health. “Certification by these respected organizations enables us to provide additional value to our customers by providing a more complete view of the care provided to patients, as well as saving health plans time and money by reducing the burden of the HEDIS primary source audit.”

HEDIS CAHPS for Health Plans Survey Vendor Certification

The NCQA Survey Vendor Certification Program helps ensure health plans get as accurate data as possible about its members’ experience. It evaluates, trains and certifies private market research firms to administer the HEDIS CAHPS survey on behalf of health plans.

About Certification

The HEDIS® CAHPS® 5.0H survey measures the experience of health plan members. HEDIS CAHPS results are required for NCQA Health Plan Accreditation. State and federal regulators may require HEDIS CAHPS for their programs, also.

The NCQA Survey Vendor Certification program evaluates, trains and certifies private market research firms to administer the HEDIS CAHPS survey on behalf of health plans. It is a comprehensive oversight process, simultaneous to survey administration, that facilitates high-quality data that can be compared across plans.

The program promotes data collection standardization, in accordance with the specifications and protocols in HEDIS Volume 3: Specifications for Survey Measures.

By obtaining certification, organizations can:

Learn and align with NCQA protocols for CAHPS 5.0H survey data collection.

Be distinguished in the exchange as survey vendors trained and certified by NCQA.

Become a preferred survey vendor of choice for health plans seeking NCQA Accreditation or seeking to meet federal and/or state requirements.

Becoming Certified

Submit the RFP and application fee to NCQA (cahps@ncqa.org).

If accepted, participate in survey vendor training in October for new vendors.

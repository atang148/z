About measure certification

NCQA’s Measure Certification program validates organizations’ HEDIS®, “Align. Measure. Perform. (AMP)” and other quality measure logic used to calculate measure results or select eligible patients’ administrative or clinical data sources to ensure production of accurate results.

Accuracy is critical for health plans, provider organizations and other organizations that rely on quality measurement data to make decisions for quality reporting and inform value-based contracting. By earning NCQA Measure Certification, organizations know their measure logic has gone through the industry’s most rigorous assessment.

Who must be certified?

Organizations interested in offering a product or service using NCQA’s HEDIS measures or the Integrated Healthcare Association’s (IHA) AMP measures must first earn NCQA Measure Certification to demonstrate to partners and customers that coded measures meet current NCQA standards and produce accurate and comparable results.

Federal, state and other public-sector entities that use a third-party vendor to calculate HEDIS measure rates in their public-sector program may be required to use an NCQA-Certified vendor or have their selected vendor complete NCQA’s Measure Certification program.

Health plans that submit HEDIS measure rates to NCQA may contract directly with NCQA to certify their measure logic instead of using an NCQA-Certified vendor. Health plans and provider organizations that submit measure rates for the AMP program may contract directly with NCQA to certify their measure logic.

What certification programs are available?

HEDIS Health Plan Certification. Certifies unadjusted HEDIS health plan measures. Vendors must be certified for all certifiable measures they report to NCQA. Entities that do not submit HEDIS data to NCQA, but use HEDIS measures and specifications in a commercial product or service, must be certified for all measures used. Organizations that earn Health Plan Certification also receive credit for HEDIS Allowable Adjustments Certification at no additional cost.

HEDIS Allowable Adjustments Certification. Organizations that do not calculate HEDIS measures using health plan attribution (continuous enrollment) are eligible for this certification. Entities that do not submit HEDIS measure rates to NCQA, but use HEDIS measures and specifications in a commercial product or service, must be certified on all measures used.

NCQA’s AMP Certification. Certifies IHA AMP measures. Vendors that submit AMP measure rates to IHA must be certified for all certifiable measures being reported to IHA.

eMeasure Certification. For more information on this program, visit the eMeasure Certification program page. A custom commercial use license with NCQA is required for use of NCQA’s publicly available electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM).

Benefits

Save time. Certified measures are exempt from manual source code review during the HEDIS Compliance Audit® and the AMP Audit Compliance Review. Learn more about this benefit. Manual source code review will phase out in 2021. For reporting in 2022, plans and provider organizations that code their own measure logic must switch to an NCQA-Certified vendor in 2021 or contract directly with NCQA to certify their measure logic.Certification incorporates new HEDIS measures into the testing process, reducing time and resource use.

Using certified vendors

Before accessing a NCQA-certified vendor’s product or services containing NCQA intellectual property, you must agree to NCQA’s End User License Agreement (EULA). The EULA will be provided to you by a:

certified vendor as a direct customer of the certified vendor

direct customer of the certified vendor as an authorized user of the direct customer

reseller of the certified vendor’s product as a licensed user of the reseller

Direct customers of a certified vendor will receive a slightly modified EULA from the certified vendor that grants permission to provide access to NCQA’s intellectual property through the certified vendor’s product to third parties, termed “authorized users,” subject to passing through the EULA to the authorized users.

The EULA may be modified or replaced on a going-forward basis and will be identified as the most recent version by the date. Please check NCQA’s website periodically for changes to the EULA; however, NCQA will attempt to notify all vendors if any material modifications are made. If you are dissatisfied with the terms in the agreement or any modifications to the agreement, then you should discontinue use of the product or services.

  Quality Compass® 

Quality Compass® is an indispensable tool for selecting a health plan, conducting competitor analysis, examining quality improvement and benchmarking plan performance.

You can also generate custom reports by selecting (depending on license) commercial (private), Medicaid and Medicare plans, measures (HEDIS® and CAHPS®) and benchmarks (averages and percentiles) for up to 3 trended years.

  Custom Data Licenses 

NCQA offers custom data licenses for its health plan performance data, including HEDIS performance measures and CAHPS member satisfaction results, tailored to your specific need.

Versatile performance data licenses are designed for consultants, employers, software vendors and other health care stakeholders and for various uses, including self-built report cards and benefit communication tools. They are the perfect complement to any health care research or quality improvement initiative.

  File 5 

Organizations contract with NCQA-Certified Survey Vendors to administer surveys using HEDIS survey specifications and to submit collected data to NCQA for calculation of HEDIS survey results.

File 5 Commercial and Medicaid Licenses contain blinded member satisfaction data from the HEDIS/CAHPS 5.0H Adult Survey.

  CAHPS Booklet 

The CAHPS Booklet is an analysis file that includes the comprehensive Adult and Child CAHPS benchmark data, in addition to:

The total number of completed surveys.

National percentiles for the global proportion.

Composite means for all composite and rating measures.

Frequency of survey item responses for all publicly reportable survey measures.

  Health Plan Ratings Excel Download 

NCQA’s Health Insurance Plan Ratings list private, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance plans based on their combined HEDIS, CAHPS and NCQA Accreditation standards scores.

Ratings classify plans into ratings from 0–5 in 0.5 increments–a system similar to the CMS Five-Star Quality Rating System.

  Recognition Program Data Access 

NCQA Recognition programs help employers, health plans, patients and consumers make informed heath care decisions based on quality. Participation in an NCQA Recognition program demonstrates that a provider or practice values quality health care delivery and uses the latest clinical protocols to ensure that patients receive the best care, at the right time.

This data file provides access to all descriptive data for each recognized clinician in an easy-to-use Excel format for different analytical needs. All data are updated regularly.

Plain writing  


We’re committed to writing so you can understand

At the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), we’ve done a lot, like training our staff, to make sure we use plain language in any document that:

Is necessary for obtaining any federal government benefit or service or filing taxes

Provides information about any federal government benefit or service

Explains to the public how to comply with a requirement that the federal government administers or enforces

Let us know if you’re having trouble

Let us know if you have trouble understanding our documents or the pages on our website. We've assigned staff to oversee our plain language efforts:

Erin Gordon, Plain Language Coordinator

Cate Kortzeborn, Plain Language Coordinator (Regional Offices)

It may feel like you were just at the pediatrician's office and now you're headed back again. Your baby will visit the doctor for more routine checkups in his first year than in any other year of his life.

The point of these visits is to make sure your baby is growing, developing normally, and staying healthy. They are also a great opportunity to ask any questions you have about your child's development, safety, immunizations, and nutrition.

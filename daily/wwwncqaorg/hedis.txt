HEDIS and Performance Measurement

The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is one of health care’s most widely used performance improvement tools. 190 million people are enrolled in plans that report HEDIS results. Visitors to this page often check HEDIS FAQs, QRS FAQs, or ask a question through MyNCQA.

HEDIS Measures

HEDIS® includes more than 90 measures across 6 domains of care:

Effectiveness of Care.

Experience of Care.

Measurement Certification Programs

HEDIS Reports and Research

Accountable health care requires both measurement and transparency. That is why we publish what we learn from HEDIS in many forums and formats.

The Future of HEDIS

Digital Quality Measures build on the HEDIS foundation, creating more efficient data collection and reporting, and better accountability at all levels. Visitors to this page often check HEDIS FAQs, QRS FAQs, or ask a question through MyNCQA.

 

5 Topics and Themes

The future of HEDIS focuses on 5 core ideas:

Allowable Adjustments: New flexibility lets users modify measures without changing their clinical intent.

Licensing and Certification: Updated requirements ensure accuracy of measure results.

Digital Measures: HEDIS specifications that download directly into users’ data systems bring new ease.

Electronic Clinical Data Systems (ECDS): This new reporting method helps clinical data create insight for managing the health of individuals and groups.

Schedule Change: A new schedule gives users more time by giving them complete measure specs sooner—11 months earlier than the current timeline.

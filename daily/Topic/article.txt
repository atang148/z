How do I get a replacement Medicare card? 

Your Medicare card is proof of your Medicare insurance. If your Medicare card was lost, stolen, or destroyed, you can ask for a replacement by using your online my Social Security account.  If you don’t already have an account, you can create one online. Go to Sign In or Create an Account.  Once you are logged in to your account, select the "Replacement Documents" tab.  Then select “Mail my replacement Medicare Card.”  Your Medicare card will arrive in the mail in about 30 days at the address on file with Social Security. If you do not receive your new Medicare card after 30 days, there may be something that needs to be corrected, like your mailing address. Make sure the mailing address is correct. If not, you can update it using your personal my Social Security account.

If you need to know your new Medicare Number, please visit myMedicare.gov/ account and sign in. You can see your Medicare Number and print an official copy of your card. If you don’t have a myMedicare.gov/ account yet, go to ‘create an account’ and follow the instructions.

If you can’t or prefer not to use the online service, you can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227 TTY 1-877-486-2048).

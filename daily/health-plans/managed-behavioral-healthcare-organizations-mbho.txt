Managed Behavioral Healthcare Organization

NCQA Managed Behavioral Healthcare Organization Accreditation demonstrates to health plans, employers, regulators and consumers an organization’s commitment to follow evidence-based practices to provide high-quality care.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

Managing behavioral health plays a key role in the current emphasis for health care providers to deliver care that incorporates medical, behavioral and social risk factors. As managed behavioral health care grows, so does the need to discern the value of behavioral healthcare providers.

The NCQA MBHO Accreditation standards are a roadmap for improvement. They help organizations implement industry best practices to provide high-quality care, access and consumer protections. Key areas are:

Care coordination to reduce fragmented care.

Complex case management, a challenge for initiatives where complex cases are common.

Data exchange between health plans and behavioral healthcare organizations, to support clinical quality and patient experience measurement and improvement.

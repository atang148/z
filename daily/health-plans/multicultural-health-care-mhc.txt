Distinction in Multicultural Health Care

NCQA Distinction in Multicultural Health Care identifies organizations that excel in providing culturally and linguistically sensitive services, and work to reduce health care disparities.

For patients to receive the best care possible, organizations responsible for that care must be aware of and be sensitive to their populations’ racial, cultural and language differences.

NCQA Distinction in Multicultural Health Care identifies organizations—health plans, MCOs, MBHOs, wellness and population health organizations and others—that lead the market in providing culturally and linguistically sensitive services, and working to reduce health care disparities.

Why Earn Distinction in Multicultural Health Care?

A 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation report found that people of color face significant disparities in access to and utilization of care, and that certain groups do worse on measures of health status and outcomes.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notes that “by tailoring services to an individual’s culture and language preferences, health professionals can help bring about positive health outcomes for diverse populations.”

NCQA awards Distinction in Multicultural Health Care to organizations that meet or exceed standards in providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). NCQA evaluates how well an organization complies with standards for:

Collecting race/ethnicity and language data.

Providing language assistance.

Cultural responsiveness.

Quality improvement of CLAS.

Reduction of health care disparities.

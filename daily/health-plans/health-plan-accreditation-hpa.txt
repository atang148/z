Health Plan Accreditation (HPA)

Health plans must support care that keeps members at optimum levels of health while also controlling costs and meeting government and purchaser requirements. NCQA Health Plan Accreditation helps plans meet these goals.

JUST RELEASED: HEALTH PLAN 2020

Every year NCQA makes adjustments to its standards to respond to feedback from plans, policy makers, providers, patients and others. This year, in addition to modifications to the standards, NCQA made updates to how we score and award accreditation to create a more straight forward and transparent process while maintaining strong consumer protections.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

NCQA Health Plan Accreditation builds upon more than 25 years of experience to provide a current, rigorous and comprehensive framework for essential quality improvement and measurement. It is the only program in the industry that bases results on clinical performance and consumer experience (HEDIS® and CAHPS®).

NCQA standards are a roadmap for improvement—organizations use them to perform a gap analysis and align improvement activities with areas that are most important to states and employers, such as network adequacy and consumer protection. Standards evaluate plans on:

Quality Management and Improvement.

Population Health Management.

Network Management.

Utilization Management.

Credentialing and Recredentialing.

Members’ Rights and Responsibilities.

Member Connections.

Medicaid Benefits and Services.

The use of HEDIS data allows the Health Plan Accreditation to effectively measure care and service performance. This focuses attention on activities that keep members healthy.

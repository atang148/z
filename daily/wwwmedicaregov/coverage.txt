Your Medicare Coverage

Your Medicare Coverage

Didn’t find what you’re looking for?

Use this list if you’re a person with Medicare, family member or caregiver. Medicare coverage for many tests, items and services depends on where you live. This list only includes tests, items and services (both covered and non-covered) if coverage is the same no matter where you live.
	 
	If your test, item or service isn’t listed, talk to your doctor or other health care provider about why you need certain tests, items or services. Ask if Medicare will cover them.


If your test, item or service isn’t listed, talk to your doctor or other health care provider about why you need certain tests, items or services. Ask if Medicare will cover them.

Use this list if you’re a Medicare contractor, provider or other health care industry professional. This list includes the ability to search by procedure codes (CPT/HCPCS codes).

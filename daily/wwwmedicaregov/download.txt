Download Database

You have the option of downloading the data used in the search and compare tools onto your computer.  This option is primarily used by health policy researchers and the media. You should not download the databases if you are simply trying to find out what is available in your area. You can do this by using the Search Tools as they are on the website.
			

Please note that the downloadable databases are available as zipped Microsoft Access databases and also in CSV (comma separated values) format for some databases. In order to use the downloadable databases, you must have a working knowledge of Microsoft Access.

Note: Opening CSV files in Excel will remove leading zeros from data fields. Since some data, such as provider numbers, contain leading zeros, it is recommended that you open CSV files using text editor programs such as Notepad to copy or view CSV file content.


			If you wish to download this data, please realize that downloading may take some time (10-30 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer's modem). These databases are updated on a monthly basis (and sometimes more frequently).

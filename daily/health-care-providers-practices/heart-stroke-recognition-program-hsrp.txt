Heart/Stroke Recognition Program

The Heart/Stroke Recognition Program provides clinicians with tools that support delivery of high-quality care to patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or who have had a stroke.

What Is Heart/Stroke Recognition?

This program recognizes clinicians who use evidence-based measures to provide quality care to their CVD and stroke patients. Recognition makes you part of an elite group that is publicly recognized for providing the highest level of care.

NCQA Updates to Heart/Stroke Recognition

NCQA made minor changes that were effective February 5, 2018. Changes provide updated codes to the NDC list, value set and data dictionary for the Statin Therapy for Patients With Cardiovascular Disease (SPC) HEDIS measure.

Update to NDC List Table Names

As HEDIS® measures evolve, more information may be necessary for measurement. NCQA will provide NDC lists for practices to use when submitting measurement data. A link to the NDC list is available in the resources section of the data collection tool. The NDC table names for SPC have changed but the content remains the same. Below are the new table names to identify NDC codes for the SPC measure.

Table SPC-A: Estrogen Agonists Medications List

Table SPC-B: High and Moderate-Intensity Statin Medications List

Updated Value Set and Data Dictionary Codes for HSRP

The list of eligible ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to identify patients with ischemic vascular disease (IVD) has changed. The current value set is available in the resources section of the data collection tool.

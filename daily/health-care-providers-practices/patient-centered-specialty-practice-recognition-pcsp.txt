Patient-Centered Specialty Practice (PCSP) Recognition

The PCSP Recognition program helps facilitate team-based care by improving collaboration with primary care and recognizing specialists who streamline and improve health care delivery.

What is NCQA PCSP Recognition?

The PCSP Recognition program builds on the success of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition program by recognizing specialty practices that excel in delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. It focuses on proactive coordination and sharing information. Everyone in the practice works as a team to coordinate care with primary care, other referring clinicians, community resources and secondary services.

Practices are encouraged to organize care around patients and coordinate and track care over time. Specialty practices are required to organize care across all practices and patient visits—centering care on the patient, instead of on the care setting.

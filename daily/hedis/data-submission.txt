HEDIS Data Submission

NCQA collects HEDIS data from health plans, health care organizations and government agencies. Data are used to improve HEDIS measures and the health care system. Visitors to this page often check HEDIS FAQs, QRS FAQs, or ask a question through MyNCQA.

IDSS Redesign

Beginning with HEDIS 2021, HEDIS measure data will be collected in the new format through the updated IDSS system. With this new format, the data elements under the measures will be more relational, modular, reusable and meaningfully named and structured. Measures with different stratifications will have data points gathered in groups such as age, gender and socio-economic status.

Data Submission Details

NCQA collects HEDIS®  survey results directly from health plans and PPOs through the Healthcare Organization Questionnaire (HOQ), and collects non-survey data though the Interactive Data Submission System (IDSS).

HEDIS data help calculate national performance statistics and benchmarks, and set standards for measures in NCQA Accreditation.

With plan permission, commercial data are also included in Quality Compass®. Health plans, purchasers, consultants and the media use Quality Compass data for comparative health plan performance analyses.

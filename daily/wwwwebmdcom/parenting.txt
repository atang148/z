You answered: 
 


Correct Answer:

a

True




b

False



 Answer 1/10You should correct your child's homework.



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




Teachers give homework for various reasons, especially in the early grades. Some do it mostly to track a child's learning and progress, and want to see what the child does entirely on his or her own, including mistakes. Others, especially with older kids, use homework to practice and reinforce skills. For this kind of homework it may be helpful to have a parent review it and make suggestions for improvement. You should still leave those fixes up to your child to make. If you're not sure what your child's teacher expects, ask!

 Answer 1/10What's the ideal time for your child to do his homework?



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




All kids are different, so this isn't a "one size fits all" rule. But children generally do better with homework when they aren't distracted by late-afternoon hunger pangs. So a snack before settling in with their work is a good idea. The most important thing is to schedule a regular study routine and stick to it.

 Answer 1/10Your child will do best if he does his homework at the same time every day.



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




Consistency is important for homework success. But that doesn't mean your child must be sitting down with his books and papers at exactly 4:15 p.m. every day. A routine can mean reliable, daily behavioral guidelines like, "You can play with your brother as soon as you've finished your homework," or "Homework must be finished before dinnertime."

 Answer 1/10My child is having trouble with her homework. What should I do?



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




It's normal for children to need a parent's guidance while starting homework assignments, or to ask questions about a challenging concept. But if your child is having trouble, the answer isn't for you to do the work. Before worrying about a learning disability, talk to your child's teacher about the trouble she's having. Find out if more can be done in the classroom to prepare her for what she has to do at home.

Question

 Answer 1/10How much time should a first-grader be spending on homework?



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




For K-2 kids, most experts say that 10-20 minutes of homework per day is best, helping reinforce what they're learning in class without overwhelming them.

Researchers into homework have developed what's known as the "10-minute rule." It suggests that about 10 minutes of homework per grade is most beneficial. That means that even in high school, more than about two hours of homework a night is probably too much.

True




b
False
 


False



 Answer 1/10Most kids can benefit from homework.



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




Research has shown that homework is an important part of learning for all kids. Some parents say that their child just doesn't respond to homework. But it might just be that he's getting the wrong kindof homework. For example, homework for young kids should be short, sometimes involve activities they enjoy, and lead to success without a lot of struggle. If it's the wrong kind of work for your child's age, or if he's being loaded down with too much, homework may be more frustrating than helpful. Talk to his teacher for advice.

 Answer 1/10Kids today do how much more homework than 20 or 30 years ago?



 
You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




Despite what it may seem like, research shows that kids are getting about the same amounts of homework today as the children of previous generations. In most cases, kids aren't horribly overloaded with homework. In fact, they spend more time doing almost every other activity, including playing, shopping, and helping around the house.

Teachers' policies about using computers for homework vary. Ask your child's teacher what she prefers. She may encourage your child to use a computer for research and for doing assignments. Some teachers post homework, projects, and extra information for students online. Help your child when she asks, and make sure she's well-organized in her homework space.

You answered: 
 


Correct Answer: 
 




There are many ways you can help your child manage her homework. Kids aren't born knowing how to organize and plan. Helping her learn to set priorities, figure out how long a project might take, and use a calendar or other planner is important. Limiting after-school activities to one or two favorites gives her more time to focus on schoolwork. If there's something she's just not getting, help her get comfortable with the idea of asking her teacher for extra guidance.

Skin Care Basics

Your skin reflects your health. To take care of it, you need to build healthy habits.


Stay clean. Wash your face twice a day -- once in the morning and once at night before you go to bed. After you cleanse your skin, follow with a toner and moisturizer. Toners help to remove fine traces of oil, dirt, and makeup you may have missed when cleansing. Look for a moisturizer geared toward your skin type -- dry, normal, or oily. Yes, even oily skin can benefit from a moisturizer.

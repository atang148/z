Quality Solutions Group

Putting NCQA expertise to work for you.

What We Do

We help agencies and organizations benefit from our decades of experience:

Measuring quality.

Improving quality.

Reforming health care delivery.

Why QSG

We created our Quality Solutions Group (QSG) to respond to a growing demand for tailor-made assistance in today’s value-based environment. We help our clients with:

Performance measure development and implementation. We can help you develop and adapt measures for diverse settings and data sources, including electronic clinical quality measures and patient-reported outcomes measures. We can also translate data into actionable information such as customized performance reports.

Benchmarking, comparative analysis and identification of high performers and best practices. We can help you know where you stand, what you are doing right and who your best performers are.

Innovative approaches for vulnerable populations. This can include those who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, those who are impacted by social determinants and those with advanced care needs.

Patient-centered practice transformation. We can help you work to transform health care delivery to what patients want it to be. Our stewardship of the largest Patient-Centered Medical Home program, the only Patient-Centered Specialty Practice program and other “medical neighborhood” programs gives us a unique insight and ability. We can tailor these innovations to address specific priorities, such as behavioral care.

Using our proven evaluation methods to help your organization with web-based data submission systems and data management.

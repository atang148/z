Patient-Centered Connected Care Recognition

Now, more than ever, patients can choose how—and where—they receive care. But while choice has resulted in convenience for patients, care coordination often suffers.

NCQA Patient-Centered Connected Care™ Recognition was built from the medical home model of care, and identifies how sites delivering infrequent or outpatient treatment—urgent care centers, retail clinics, worksite health clinics and others—communicate and connect with primary care and fit into the medical home “neighborhood.”

What is Patient-Centered Connected Care?

As the health care system moves to improve and reward integration, providers must build trust by demonstrating their commitment to fully integrated, patient-centered care. NCQA’s Patient-Centered Connected Care Recognition program contains best practices for delivering patient-centered care.

Sites are evaluated on five standards:

Connecting with primary care. The site connects and shares information with patients’ primary care providers and helps patients find a primary care provider if they don’t have one.

Identifying patient needs. The site directs patients to appropriate providers when necessary.

Patient care and support. The site uses evidence-based decision support in care delivery, collaborates with patients to make care decisions and delivers culturally and linguistically appropriate services.

System capabilities: The site uses electronic systems to collect data and execute specific tasks.

Measure and improve performance: The provider systematically monitors performance and carries out activities to improve clinical outcomes and patient experience.

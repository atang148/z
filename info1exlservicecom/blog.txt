Medicare Advantage plans with high STAR and HEDIS rankings receive substantial bonuses and reimbursements. Achieving the necessary scores to receive these payouts can be critically important to healthcare plans operating under increasingly tight budgets. Depending on the size of the plan, these financial incentives can result in millions of dollars in revenue.

Due to the sizeable amount of these payouts, health plans have begun forming teams focused on boosting HEDIS and STAR rankings. However, they often approach these ratings as completely separate from each other. This increases the workload and administrative costs for plans that are often finding themselves already overextended.

Recognizing Rating Overlaps

Even though these different ratings are meant to measure different metrics, the truth is there are significant overlaps between STAR and HEDIS ratings. In fact, the two rankings are based share 30% of the same metrics. By focusing on these overlapping areas, healthcare providers can rapidly improve both measures at the same time.

Improving Patient Outcomes, Boosting Revenue

Both STAR and HEDIS ratings use patient outcomes to determine how well a plan is doing. Considering that 75% of Medicare Advantage plan members have some sort of chronic health condition, ensuring these patients receive the proper diagnosis and follow-up care can have a large effect on a plan’s ranking.

Analytics can be useful to make sure that patients are receiving the right kind of care. For instance, if a plan were to institute a database showing which members had an upcoming screening, they could send these patients reminders about their appointment. Doing so increases the likelihood that members get the care they need, and health plans get the benefits from high STAR and HEDIS rankings.

Implementing a patient database isn’t the only method for health plans to take advantage of the overlaps in the STAR and HEDIS ratings. Even if it were, finding methods to consolidate all the different sources of patient data can be a tricky process. To find out how to take advantage of other measurements shared by these two rankings, improve patient outcomes and boost revenue, download EXL’s white paper The Power of 2.

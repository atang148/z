For over 25 years Omnicell has been inspired to create safer and more efficient ways to manage medications and supplies across all healthcare settings.

As a leader in medication and supply dispensing automation, central pharmacy automation and medication adherence and packaging systems, Omnicell is focused on improving care across the entire healthcare continuum—from hospital to community pharmacy and from long-term care facilities to the patient’s home.

Over 4,000 customers worldwide use Omnicell automation and analytics solutions to increase operational efficiency, reduce medication errors and improve patient safety. In the UK you can find our products in NHS hospitals, private hospitals, care homes and thousands of local pharmacies where they are helping to reduce medication errors and are enabling clinicians to spend more time with patients.

Omnicell Retweeted Jonah Comstock

Pharmacy is a promising area for clinicians to spread their wings; AI stands to play a key role in the Autonomous Pharmacy, which will allow pharmacists to focus more on providing care and less on sorting, picking, or any other error prone manual tasks/workflows.https://twitter.com/JonahComstock/status/1169244252775342080 …

Omnicell added,








Jonah Comstock @JonahComstock

Here's a twist on the "AI taking our jobs" question for folks in healthcare: 

Say you had a young medical student in your life who was getting ready to choose a specialty. Are there any you would suggest or warn against because of where you see the technology going?

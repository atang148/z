WebMD My Medicine Help


Q:
What is an interaction?



A:
Mixing certain medicines together may cause a bad reaction. This is called an interaction. For example, one medicine may cause side effects that create problems with other medicines. Or one medicine may make another medicine stronger or weaker.



Q:
How do you classify the seriousness of an interaction?



A:
The following classification is used:



Contraindicated:  Never use this combination of drugs because of high risk for dangerous interaction



Serious:  Potential for serious interaction; regular monitoring by your doctor required or alternate medication may be needed



Significant: Potential for significant interaction (monitoring by your doctor is likely required)



Mild: Interaction is unlikely, minor, or nonsignificant



Q:
What should I do if my medications show interactions?



A:
Call your doctor or pharmacist if you are concerned about an interaction. Do not stop taking any prescribed medication without your doctor's approval.  Sometimes the risk of not taking the medication outweighs the risk or the interaction.



Q:
Why can't I enter my medication?



A:
There may be medications, especially otc or supplements, that have not been adequately studied for interactions. If we do not have interaction information for a certain medication it can't be saved in My Medicine.



Q:
Do you cover all FDA warnings?



A:
WebMD will alert users to the most important FDA warnings and alerts affecting consumers such as recalls, label changes and investigations. Not all FDA actions are included. Go to the FDA for a comprehensive list of warnings.



Q:
Can I be alerted by email if there is an FDA warning or alert?



A:
Yes. If you are signed in to WebMD.com and using My Medicine you can sign up to receive email alerts when you add a medicine. To unsubscribe click here.



Q:
Can I add medicines for family members?



A:
Yes. Click the arrow next to your picture to add drug profiles for family or loved ones.



Q:
Can I access My Medicine from my mobile phone?



A:
Yes. Sign in to the WebMD Mobile App. Your saved medicine can be found under "Saved."



Q:
Why are there already medicines saved when this my first time using this tool?



A:
If you have previously saved a medication on WebMD, for example, in the WebMD Mobile App, these may display in My Medicine.

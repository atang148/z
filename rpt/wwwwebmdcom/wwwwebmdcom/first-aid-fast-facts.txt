First Aid: Fast Facts for Proper Wound Care


		Warmer weather is finally here, which means our days are filled with outdoor adventures that can sometimes lead to minor cuts, scrapes and burns. So, it's important to choose a first aid treatment like Betadine® Antiseptic Cream to protect ourselves and keep the fun going for months to come.
	


		Walk down the first aid aisle at any pharmacy and you’ll find dozens of options. Plus, hundreds of articles and videos online boasting the “best” natural remedies can leave you puzzled about which treatment to choose. When it comes to minor wound care, the choice should be simple. Let's review some first aid facts and how Betadine can help protect yourself and your family.
	


Treat wounds promptly. Both our environment and our skin’s surface naturally contain germs, some of which may cause infection.1,2,3 Infections can significantly delay healing,4 and leaving wounds to heal on their own is a game your family shouldn’t play as it can leave your wounds exposed to potentially harmful germs. To support healthy healing, make Betadine your go-to antiseptic to kill a variety of germs when treating minor cuts, scrapes and burns.
	


		Plus, there’s no need to wait until you get home to treat these minor wounds. Betadine is now available as an easy-to-apply cream for convenient treatment at home or on-the-go.
	


Avoid alcohol to limit irritation. While it’s true that alcohol is an effective antiseptic, it can also irritate the skin and delay wound healing. Betadine is different. With its
		No-Sting Promise, it works fast to kill germs.
	


Start with a clean slate. Always clean the minor wound before applying Betadine. Once treated with Betadine, you can cover the minor wound with a bandage if needed. Betadine can be used 1-3 times daily.
	

Your Go-To First Aid Kit Checklist


		Replenishing our first aid kits may not be at the top of our to-do lists, but first aid products do expire over time. It's time to take a look inside your first aid kit and restock those must-have items.
	


		(In fact, print this page and bring this shopping list with you to the pharmacy.)
	

Topical antiseptic, like Betadine® Antiseptic Cream

Hydrocortisone ointment

Adhesive and gauze bandages

Instant ice packs

Aspirin or ibuprofen

Tweezers

Medical tape


		It’s also helpful to include a list of emergency contact phone numbers in your first aid kit in case you need to reach your family’s medical providers.
	

Why Betadine?


		When it comes to keeping your family protected, start smart with Betadine (povidone-iodine), a topical antiseptic, as your first line of defense to help prevent infections before they start.
	

Betadine brand has been trusted by hospitals for more than 50 years.

Gentle on minor wounds and surrounding skin to support healthy healing.

Does not contain alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and has a No-Sting Promise.

The golden-brown color lets you know where the antiseptic was applied and gives you peace of mind to know it’s working.

What is povidone-iodine?


		Remember when your parents or grandparents used a bottle of iodine to treat your cuts and scrapes? While it is effective, this treatment was typically mixed with alcohol, which can cause irritation and delay wound healing.
	


		Betadine’s povidone-iodine formula does not contain alcohol or peroxide, which can sting when applied. Betadine has a No-Sting promise. This means less squirming and “ouchies,” making treating minor wounds easier for you and your child.
	

Trusted from Hospital to Home


		A trusted brand in hospitals for more than 50 years, Betadine is shown to cause minimal irritation and allergic reactions.5,6,7,8 It kills a wide variety of germs that can cause infection in minor cuts, scrapes and burns. Plus, the signature golden-brown color lets you know where you've applied treatment and that it is working.
	


		From the patio to the playground, there's a Betadine solution for all of your family’s wound care needs.
	


Betadine Antiseptic Solution (10% povidone-iodine) is a tried-and-true solution and a first aid kit staple.
		


Betadine Antiseptic Spray (5% povidone-iodine) offers convenient, no-touch application and treatment.
		


Betadine Antiseptic Cream (5% povidone-iodine) is the trusted Betadine formula in an easy-to-apply cream.

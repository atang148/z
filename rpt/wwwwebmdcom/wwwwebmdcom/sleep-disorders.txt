Are You Getting Enough Sleep?

The amount of sleep a person needs depends on many factors, including age. In general:

Infants (ages 0-3 months) require 14-17 hours a day.

Infants (ages 4-11 months) require 12-15 hours a day


Toddlers (ages 1-2 years) require about 11-14 hours a day.

Pre-school children (ages 3-5) require 10-13 hours a day.

School-age children (ages 6-13) require 9-11 hours a day.

Teenagers (ages 14-17) need about 8-10 hours each day.

Most adults need 7 to 9 hours a night for the best amount of sleep, although some people may need as few as 6 hours or as many as 10 hours of sleep each day.

Older adults (ages 65 and older)need 7-8 hours of sleep each day.

Women in the first 3 months of pregnancy often need several more hours of sleep than usual.

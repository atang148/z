The Basics of Arthritis


Arthritis is a broad term that covers a group of over 100 diseases. It has everything to do with your joints -- the places where your bones connect -- such as your wrists, knees, hips, or fingers. But some types of arthritis can also affect other connective tissues and organs, including your skin.

About 1 out of 5 adults have some form of the condition. It can happen to anyone, but it becomes more common as you age.

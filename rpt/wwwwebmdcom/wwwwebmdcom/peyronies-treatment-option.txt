Do you have a curved erection?It could be Peyronie's disease

Ask your healthcare professional (HCP) about XIAFLEX®, the only FDA-approved, nonsurgical treatment option for men with Peyronie's disease with a "plaque" that can be felt and a curve in their penis greater than 30 degrees at the start of therapy.

Need Help Talkingto Your HCP?

to Your HCP?

What is Peyronie's disease?

Peyronie's (pronounced "Pay-ROH-neez") disease is caused by a plaque under the skin of the penis that results in a bent, or curved penis when erect. A Peyronie's plaque may result from injury to the penis and/or genetic factors; however, the exact cause of Peyronie's disease is unknown.

Peyronie's disease is unlikely to go away on its own, and may get worse over time. That's why speaking to your HCP about it is so important.

How common is Peyronie's disease?

3%–9% of adult males, worldwide, are estimated to have Peyronie's disease, but because of the embarrassment involved, many men may not ask their HCPs about it

While Peyronie's disease occurs more often in men between 40 and 70 years old, it can occur at any adult age

Some patients with Peyronie's disease may think that it's erectile dysfunction; however, Peyronie's disease is different

XIAFLEX® is the only FDA-approved treatment for appropriate patients with Peyronie's disease

XIAFLEX® is the only treatment approved by the FDA to help treat Peyronie's disease in adult men who have a "plaque" that can be felt and a curve in their penis greater than 30 degrees when treatment is started.

Prescription XIAFLEX® is injected into the scar tissue or Peyronie's plaque. XIAFLEX® works to help weaken and break down the plaque. This along with gentle stretching and straightening activities, can help to straighten the curve in the erect penis caused by Peyronie's disease.

Results from 2 large clinical studies for XIAFLEX®

Men received either up to 4 treatment cycles of XIAFLEX® with penile modeling, or placebo injection with penile modeling*, and then were observed until 52 weeks.

The goal of 2 large clinical studies involving more than 500 patients was to:

Measure the change in erectile curvature from the beginning of the study to Week 52

Measure the change in the Bother domain score from the beginning of the study to Week 52

Evaluate safety

Improvement in erectile curvature

In the first study, men who received XIAFLEX® and penile modeling had an average change in their erectile curvature from the beginning of the study to Week 52 of 35%, compared with 18% in men who had placebo injection and penile modeling alone.*

In the second study, men who received XIAFLEX® and penile modeling had an average change in their erectile curvature from the beginning of the study to Week 52 of 33%, compared with 22% in men who had placebo injection and penile modeling alone.*

Improvement in Bother section scores from the PDQ

Patients in the studies were asked to answer questions from the Bother section of the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) at the beginning and end (Week 52) of the studies. The Bother section score is a total score from answers related to the following:

Concern about how erection looks

Concern about erection pain

Impact of Peyronie's disease on frequency of intercourse

Impact of Peyronie's disease on intercourse

In the first study, men who received XIAFLEX® and penile modeling had an average reduction in their Bother section scores of 37% from the beginning of the study to Week 52, compared with 22% in men who had placebo injection and penile modeling.*

In the second study, men who received XIAFLEX® and penile modeling had an average reduction in their Bother section scores of 35% from the beginning of the study to Week 52, compared with 18% in men who had placebo injection and penile modeling.*

*No medicine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR XIAFLEX®

Do not receive XIAFLEX® if you:

have been told by your healthcare provider that the Peyronie's plaque to be treated involves the "tube" that your urine passes through (urethra)

are allergic to collagenase clostridium histolyticum or any of the ingredients in XIAFLEX®, or to any other collagenase product. See the end of the Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in XIAFLEX®

XIAFLEX® can cause serious side effects, including:


Penile fracture (corporal rupture) or other serious injury to the penis. Receiving an injection of XIAFLEX® may cause damage to the tubes in your penis called the corpora. After treatment with XIAFLEX®, one of these tubes may break during an erection. This is called a corporal rupture or penile fracture. This could require surgery to fix the damaged area. Damage to your penis might not get better after a corporal rupture.

After treatment with XIAFLEX®, blood vessels in your penis may also break, causing blood to collect under the skin (hematoma). This could require a procedure to drain the blood from under the skin

Symptoms of corporal rupture or other serious injury to your penis may include:

a popping sound or sensation in an erect penis
sudden loss of the ability to maintain an erection
pain in your penis
purple bruising and swelling of your penis
difficulty urinating or blood in the urine

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the symptoms of corporal rupture or serious injury to the penis listed above.
Do not have sex or any other sexual activity between the first and second injections of a treatment cycle.
Do not have sex or have any other sexual activity for at least 4 weeks after the second injection of a treatment cycle with XIAFLEX® and after any pain and swelling has gone away.
XIAFLEX® for the treatment of Peyronie's disease is only available through a restricted program called the XIAFLEX® Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. For more information about the XIAFLEX® REMS Program, go to www.XIAFLEXREMS.com or call 1‑877‑942‑3539.

If you are told to stop taking a blood thinner before your XIAFLEX® injection, your healthcare provider should tell you when to restart the blood thinner. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are unsure.

What should I avoid while receiving XIAFLEX®?

Do not use a vacuum erection device during your treatment with XIAFLEX®.

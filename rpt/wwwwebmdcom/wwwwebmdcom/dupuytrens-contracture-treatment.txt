XIAFLEX® is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with Dupuytren’s contracture when a “cord” can be felt

About Dupuytren’s Contracture and XIAFLEX®

Find a specialist

Dupuytren’s contracture (DC) is a hand condition that can limit how much you can move or straighten your fingers. It is caused by a buildup of collagen under the skin in the palm of your hand, and forms a rope-like cord. The condition can worsen over time. 

Development of Dupuytren’s contracture

Collagen builds up in the palm beneath the surface of the skin

Collagen thickens into a “rope-like” cord and extends from the palm to the finger 

In time, the tightening cord can make the fingers bend inward toward the palm. This is called “contracture” (con-TRAK-shur)

Which fingers can be affected?

DC can occur in one or both hands. In either hand, the condition most commonly affects:

The ring finger and the little finger

The joints at the base of your finger and the middle of your finger

Since 2010, 100,000 patients have been treated with XIAFLEX®.* Learn more

*Based on estimates through May 2017.

See the full Terms and Conditions at XIAFLEX.com

Ask your doctor if XIAFLEX® is right for you

For patients with a cord that can be felt, your doctor may consider treatment with XIAFLEX® if you have:

Contractures ranging from less severe to more severe

Multiple contractures in 1 hand. Up to 2 cords in 1 hand may be treated during 1 office visit

Contractures that have come back. Dupuytren’s contracture may come back no matter which option you use. Nonsurgical XIAFLEX® is available if it returns

Nerve injury or other serious injury of the hand. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get numbness, tingling, increased pain, or tears in the skin (laceration) in your treated finger or hand after your injection or after your follow-up visit

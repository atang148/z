What is a personal health record?

A personal health record permits you to securely gather, store, manage and share your own and your family's health information - when you want, where you want, and with whom you choose. And the WebMD Health Record is more than your personal health history. It's smart. It works within the WebMD Health Manager to provide you useful information and direct you to tools that you might find helpful.

Why should I create a personal health record?

To easily gather, store and manage lifelong personal health information

To share relevant information with authorized care providers

To maximize your health benefits

At WebMD, we take the issue of privacy very seriously. WebMD is a recipient of the URAC e-Health Seal, a participant in the TRUSTe Privacy Program, and HON.

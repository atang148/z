Sexual Conditions Overview

Sexual conditions include sexual dysfunction problems and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. Vaginal or penal discharge and burning or pain during urination can indicate an STD. STD treatment can include medication, and prevention involves using condoms and other safe sex practices.

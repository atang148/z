ACO Accreditation

NCQA Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Accreditation provides a roadmap for ACOs, or those seeking to become ACOs, to provide patient-centered, integrated quality care.

Overview

Accountable care organizations have the potential to get better quality at lower cost by aligning incentives to promote coordination and transform health care delivery. NCQA ACO Accreditation helps health care organizations demonstrate their ability to improve quality, reduce costs and coordinate patient care. Built from NCQA’s successful Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition program, our ACO standards and guidelines incorporate whole-person care coordination throughout the health care system.

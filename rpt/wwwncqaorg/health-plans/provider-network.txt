Provider Network Accreditation

NCQA Provider Network Accreditation creates a framework for organizations to provide efficient, accurate and consistent network management and credentialing services.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

Many health insurers rely on tiered and narrow networks to manage costs, and use third-party organizations to validate their networks. In response to these network designs, states and the federal government implemented regulations requiring a minimum level of access to care and services.

The NCQA Provider Network Accreditation helps organizations maintain a high-quality network for members and clients by ensuring organizations:

Ensure appropriate client agreements.

Verify credentials.

Protect credentialing information.

Ensure credentials peer review process.

Evaluate contracted provider quality.

Monitor sanctions and complaints.

Use objective evidence.

Maintain adequate network.

Provide access to appointments.

Facilitate the continuity and coordination of care.

Provide physician directories.

Population Health Program Accreditation

Helping improve integration of population health principles into management of defined populations.

If an individuals’ journey through the health care system is fragmented and uncoordinated, the result can be increased costs and poorer outcomes.

Population health management activities can help organizations identify the needs of individuals and deliver appropriate, coordinated care, but many organizations don’t have a defined framework for effective population health management.

NCQA Population Health Program Accreditation helps organizations align their operations with the industry’s best population health management practices. Having a solid population health strategy reassures organizations and employers that they can monitor and address opportunities and challenges in their populations.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

NCQA’s standards provide a framework for organizations to standardize care, become more efficient and manage complex needs better. This helps keep members healthier, reduce risks and prevent unnecessary costs from poor care management.

The NCQA Population Health program evaluates organizations in these key areas:

Data integration.

Population assessment.

Population segmentation.

Targeted interventions.

Practitioner support.

Measurement and quality improvement.

HEDIS Electronic Clinical Data System (ECDS) Reporting

Our newest reporting method helps clinical data create insight for managing the health of individuals and groups.

ECDS News

Public Reporting for Measurement Year 2020

In September 2019, NCQA announced that Prenatal Immunization Status (PRS) will be the first publicly reported Electronic Clinical Data System (ECDS) measure. 

Health plans will use the measure in HEDIS Measurement Year 2020 and report the results in June 2021.

Why does this matter?

Public reporting of an ECDS measure is a critical step in the use of clinical data systems to measure quality.

Using and sharing clinical data will enrich the information available to providers who care for patients. Measures drawn directly from digital records can also reduce the burden on providers to collect data for quality reporting.

Ultimately, ECDS measures create insight for managing the health of individuals and groups. Public reporting helps make the promise of ECDS a reality.

Why HEDIS Measurement Year 2020?

Knowing that the first public reporting for an ECDS measure will be in HEDIS Measurement Year 2020 will give health plans advance notice – a year earlier than our typical announcement.

Why this measure?

When NCQA considers whether to advance measures to public reporting, we work with our multi-stakeholder advisory panels to assess:

The number of plans that have shown they can report the measure.

If measure results match what we expect based on other sources.

Whether results seem indicative of true performance.

Whether performance indicates an opportunity for improvement for the industry overall.

Prenatal Immunization Status meets all those criteria. In particular, the measure had:

A high number of valid submissions. Many health plans reported PRS results for Measurement Year 2018, which suggests that health plans can feasibly collect and report PRS. In addition, denominators were large. This means that health plans have enough members for reporting and is a sign of viable measure.

Variation in performance. Performance rates reflect expected results and showed opportunity for improvement.

All of these are signs of an effective measure that is ready for public reporting.

ECDS in Brief

Electronic Clinical Data Systems are a reporting standard for HEDIS and a network of data containing a plan member’s personal health information and records of their experiences within the health-care system.

The ECDS architecture was designed to help HEDIS implementers understand how health IT can increase the efficiency of quality reporting, while also providing an incentive to connect to data in these other sources.

ECDS measures inspire innovative use of electronic clinical data to document high-quality care.  Organizations that report ECDS for HEDIS encourage sharing and interoperability of health data systems, and ensure that the information needed to provide high-quality services reaches the right people when it is most useful.

What qualifies for ECDS reporting: electronic databases arranged so queries can extract information efficiently and accurately.

ECDS reporting is an important step in using information available in electronic clinical datasets to improve quality.

Types of ECDS Data

Organizations may use several data sources to provide complete information about the quality of health services delivered to its members. Data systems that may be eligible for HEDIS® ECDS reporting include, but are not limited to, member eligibility files, EHRs, clinical registries, HIEs, administrative claims systems, electronic laboratory reports (ELR), electronic pharmacy systems, immunization information systems (IIS) and disease/case management registries.

The data within these systems come in a variety of formats. The format type determines how the source is audited. Eligible data sources used for HEDIS® ECDS reporting are defined as follows:

Electronic health record (EHR).Real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. EHRs eligible for this category of ECDS reporting include the NCQA eMeasure certification program or any system that meets the 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) definition.1

Health information exchange (HIE)/clinical registry. HIEs and clinical registries eligible for this reporting category include state HIEs, immunization information systems (IIS), public health agency systems, regional HIEs (RHIO), Patient-Centered Data Homes™ or other registries developed for research or to support quality improvement and patient safety initiatives. Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients can use HIEs to access and share vital medical information, with the goal of creating a complete patient record.2Clinical registries can be sponsored by a government agency, nonprofit organization, health care facility or private company, and decisions regarding use of the data in the registry are the responsibility of the registry’s governing committee.3

Case management system. A shared database of member information collected through a collaborative process of member assessment, care planning, care coordination or monitoring of a member’s functional status and care experience. Case management systems eligible for this category of ECDS reporting include any system developed to support the organization’s case/disease management activities, including activities performed by delegates.

Includes data from administrative claim processing systems for all services incurred (i.e., paid, suspended, pending and denied) during the period defined by each measure’s participation as well as member management files, member eligibility and enrollment files, electronic member rosters, internal audit files, and member call service databases.

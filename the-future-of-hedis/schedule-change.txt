HEDIS Schedule Change

NCQA is making two significant changes to the annual HEDIS© specification publications: a change in the version naming convention for all HEDIS volumes and a shift in the timeline for publishing the specifications for HEDIS measures.

What is changing?

NCQA is bringing the complete measure specifications to the HEDIS community sooner by changing three dates in the publication timeline:

What is NOT changing?

HEDIS 2020 publications in calendar year 2019

Publication Dates for HEDIS Volumes 3, 5, 6

HEDIS Vendor Certification dates for Survey Sample Frames

Data Submission dates

Date First-Year Public Reporting is released

Quality Compass product release dates

HEDIS Publication Naming Convention Change

A new naming convention will reduce confusion among the HEDIS community in relation to the HEDIS Measurement Year and Reporting Year.

Going forward, NCQA will change the naming convention of all HEDIS Publications to refer to the measurement year for HEDIS measures.HEDIS Measurement Year ####, to be shortened to HEDIS MY #### (where “####” is the four-digit year).All HEDIS volumes will adhere to this naming convention.

HEDIS Measurement Year ####, to be shortened to HEDIS MY #### (where “####” is the four-digit year).

All HEDIS volumes will adhere to this naming convention.

The transition will coincide with the HEDIS Timeline transition process starting in HEDIS 2020 and completing in 2021.

Credentialing Accreditation

NCQA Credentialing Accreditation helps improve credentialing and protects consumers by ensuring a consistent, effective and diligent credentialing process.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

Credentialing is more than a “check-the-box” regulatory duty, it’s an essential safety component of the health care system. Health care organizations must establish the qualifications of their licensed medical professionals by assessing their background and legitimacy to provide care.

NCQA Credentialing Accreditation focuses on consumer protection and customer service improvement. It provides a framework for organizations to implement industry best practices that help them accurately and efficiently credential and recredential health care professionals.

The standards help credentialing agencies identify gaps for improvement and align services with those desired by potential contracting organizations.

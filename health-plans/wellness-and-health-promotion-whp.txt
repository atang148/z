Wellness and Health Promotion Accreditation/Certification

NCQA Wellness and Health Promotion Accreditation/Certification helps organizations design an industry-leading wellness program that effectively engages individuals to improve their health.

A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

For decades, employers have offered wellness and health promotion programs to boost morale, increase productivity and address healthcare costs. These programs aim to engage and empower individuals by assessing their health status and providing steps to choose healthy behaviors and reduce risk factors.

NCQA Wellness and Health Promotion Accreditation/Certification focuses on services most desired by employers and health plans as well as expected by consumers. It provides a framework for organizations to implement industry best practices and apply evidence-based methods proven to support health and improve outcomes.

The standards help health and wellness organizations identify gaps for improvement and align their services with those desired by potential contracting organizations.
